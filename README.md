# Data analysis for the USA commercial flights from 2003 to 2004
Project Date: Apr 2022
Individual Project / Grade A
●	Collected Used R and Python to perform the data mining, data cleaning, data processing and data analysis; Compiled all the information into a comprehensive report.

In recent years, frequent delays and congestion have become commonplace for air travelers. Air traffic has become overly concentrated at relatively few airports, especially at certain times of day, at a cost to airlines, passengers and the U.S. economy. In the following sections, I present a Flight Analysis to show the analysis of flight delays, Aircraft passenger flow analysis, cascading failures of airports, as well as models to predict flights delays. This paper uses data from the Harvard Dataverse to present its findings (https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7). 
Even though there are only 2 years data which is a small fraction of the whole flight history in the U.S., there were still considerable entries in this data set that we were able to work with. In this report, I use Python and R to create, query and edit database files. By seeing which days/weeks/months/times have the least delays, we can gain insight into what times are operating the most flights. Moreover, this report will construct analysis on 5 specific questions, including the relationship between flights’ age and delays, change of passenger volume between different locations by time, as well as cascading failures among airports. Besides, knowing how different factors impact flying can help to develop a better prediction model and reduce the uncertainty of delay and cancellation of flights.
